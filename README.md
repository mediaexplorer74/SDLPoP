# SDLPop

SDL2+SDL2_Image Port to W10M 15063 (Game "P.o.P." is not interested for me, it was used only for RnD)

## Plan of your own RnD
1. Download appx and install it at your winphone

2. Download "data" folder, unzip and transfer it form PC to your phone

3. Use some cool File Explorer (I used Storage Explorer for my parttially unlocked Lumia 950, 
   because of this great tool sees whole filesystem!) and place /data at:

   C:\Data\Users\DefApps\APPDATA\Local\Packages\SDLPoP_cj4nrm0qt9s1y

4. Try to run the game.

5. Explore the settings.

6. Inspect the quolity of graphics, sounds, game speed, etc...

7. Try to control the prince... ;)



AS IS. SDLPoP is SDL RnD only, not for gaming.
