## Plan of your own RnD
1. Download appx and install it at your winphone

2. Dowload "data" zip folder and transfer it form PC to your phone

3. Unpack "data", and place at:

   C:\Data\Users\DefApps\APPDATA\Local\Packages\SDLPoP_cj4nrm0qt9s1y

4. Try to run the game.

5. Explore the settings.

6. Inspect the quolity of graphics, sounds, game speed, etc...

7. Try to control the prince... ;)

I used Storage Explorer for my parttially unlocked Lumia 950. This tool sees whole filesystem :)

AS IS. SDLPoP is SDL RnD only, not for gaming.
